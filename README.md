# Gmail-to-CSV

I personally find Gmail API to be a bit confusing for beginners. The APIâ€™s wizard comes handy to create the project, get credentials, and authenticate them. However, the process that should be followed after that is not mentioned clearly.

Therefore, I have created a Python script that does the following:
1. Scrapes all emails from your mailbox
2. Exports all emails to CSV file which includes (Sender, Subject, Message)
3. Email content is formatted using bs4


## Installation

Create a project at https://console.developers.google.com/project and save client id, project name and client secret in credentials.json file.

Run the python environment
```
source env/bin/activate
```

Run scraper.py
```
python scraper.py
```
