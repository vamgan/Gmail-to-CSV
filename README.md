# Gmail-to-CSV

I personally find Gmail API to be a bit confusing for beginners. The APIâ€™s wizard comes handy to create the project, get credentials, and authenticate them. However, the process that should be followed after that is not mentioned clearly.

Therefore, I have created a Python script that does the following:
1. Scrapes all emails from your mailbox
2. Exports all emails to CSV file which includes (Sender, Subject, Content)
3. Email content is formatted using bs4


## Installation

Run the python environment
```
{
    source env/bin/activate
}
```

Run scraper.py
```
{
    python scraper.py
}
```
